    "    - The sequential mechanism is practically turned off in the bent conformation, the dominant mechanism for charge separation for the bent conformation lies in the concerted mechanism\n",
    "    - For the bent conformation, the charge transfer is attenuated due to a significantly reduced rate for the transfer process between the shorter and longer range CT states (CT1 ↔ CT2)\n",
